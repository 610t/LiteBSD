# PROVIDE: FILESYSTEMS
# REQUIRE: mount_local

#       This is a dummy dependency, for services which require file systems
#       to be mounted before starting.  It also serves as the default early /
#       late divider; after this point, rc.d directories are rescanned to
#       catch scripts from other file systems than /.
