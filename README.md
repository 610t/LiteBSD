Tilden
======

Project Tilden is an experimental port of 4.4BSD Lite2 operating system
to a microcontroller. Microchip PIC32MZ family of processors was
selected as a target. It is equipped with MMU with paging support,
and 512kbytes of on-chip RAM. These resources seem enough to build
a compact embedded system based on 4.4BSD.
