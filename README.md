LiteBSD
======

LiteBSD is a variant of 4.4BSD operating system adaptet for microcontrollers.
Currently, only the Microchip PIC32MZ family is supported as a target.
It is equipped with MMU with paging support, and 512kbytes of on-chip RAM.
These resources are enough to build a compact networked embedded system.
