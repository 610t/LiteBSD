emg-modern
==========
emg, or Ersatz Mg, is a very tiny Emacs-like text editor created by
combining elements of Ersatz Emacs and Mg.

emg-modern is the bigger version of emg. It will run almost
anywhere and has enough features to be a useful text editor.

You can get a tarball of the latest release at

emg is known to work on all modern POSIX systems.
Install it with the usual:
```
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

emg is Public Domain, because Ersatz Emacs and Mg are both Public
Domain and it would be insulting to all involved to change that.
